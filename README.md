# Global Happiness Prediction from World Happiness Report

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and predict global happiness levels by examining various socioeconomic and psychological factors that influence people's well-being across countries. By exploring the relationships between indicators such as GDP per capita, social support, health, freedom of life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption, the project aims to identify the key drivers of happiness and uncover patterns in global well-being. This analysis can provide valuable insights for policymakers, organizations, and researchers working to enhance societal well-being and improve quality of life globally.

## Specific Goals

### 1. Understand the Drivers of Happiness
- Explore how factors like GDP, social support, health, and freedom contribute to happiness levels across different countries and regions.
- Identify the key socioeconomic and psychological factors that most influence happiness scores globally.

### 2. Identify Global Trends
- Analyze trends in happiness scores globally and regionally.
- Identify regions or countries with consistently high or low happiness levels.

### 3. Predict Happiness Scores
- Build predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast happiness scores based on available features like GDP, social support, and other socio-economic variables.

### 4. Assess the Role of Governance and Perception
- Investigate the influence of governance factors such as freedom and perceptions of corruption on happiness.
- Analyze how governance correlates with other metrics influencing happiness scores.

### 5. Visualize Relationships
- Create meaningful visualizations to represent the relationships between key variables.
- Highlight patterns, outliers, and correlations to provide a deeper understanding of global well-being.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project is from the [**World Happiness Report**](https://worldhappiness.report/data/), which contains various indicators that influence happiness across different countries. Here's a brief explanation of each column in the dataset:

- **Country**: Name of the country.
- **Region**: Region to which the country belongs.
- **Year**: The year of the happiness report data (e.g., 2019, 2020, etc.).
- **Log GDP per capita**: The natural logarithm of the country's GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) to account for differences in the cost of living between countries.
- **Social support**: The national average of binary responses (either 0 or 1 representing No/Yes) to the question about having relatives or friends to count on in times of trouble.
- **Healthy life expectancy**: The average number of years a newborn infant would live in good health, based on mortality rates and life expectancy at different ages.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: The national average of responses to the question about satisfaction with freedom to choose what to do with one's life.
- **Generosity**: The residual of regressing the national average of responses to the question about donating money to charity on GDP per capita.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: The national average of survey responses to questions about the perceived extent of corruption in the government and businesses.
- **Positive affect**: The national average of responses to questions about positive emotions experienced yesterday.
- **Negative affect**: The national average of responses to questions about negative emotions experienced yesterday.
- **Ladder score**: The happiness score for each country, based on responses to the Cantril Ladder question that asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0.
